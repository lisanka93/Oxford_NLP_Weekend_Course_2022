    "\n",
    "Stopwords are the words that are used very frequently. Words like “of, are, the, it, is” are some examples of stopwords. In applications like document search engines and document classification, where keywords are more important than general terms, removing stopwords can be a good idea. However, when searching for song lyrics or quores, stopwords can be important. \n",
    "\n",
    "“To be, or not to be” - Stopwords in such phrases actually play an important role, and hence, should not be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is negation. \"not\" is contained in many stopword lists, but deleting \"not\" out of a negative review can make a positive out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common approaches to removing the stopwords, and both are fairly straightforward. One way is to count all the word occurrences, and providing a threshold value on the count, and getting rid of all the terms/words occurring more than the specified threshold value. The other way is to have a predetermined list of stopwords, which can be removed from the list of tokens/tokenized sentences. In the beginning, the second one may be better, as determining thresholds can be quite difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK comes with many corpora, including a stopword list. This list contains around 200 terms.
